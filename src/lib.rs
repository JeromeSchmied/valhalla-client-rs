//! This crate contains the types and functions for interacting with the Valhalla API.
//!
//! At the moment, only the routing API is implemented.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use valhalla_client::{Valhalla, Location, Manifest};;
//! let valhalla = Valhalla::default();
//!
//! let manifest = Manifest {
//!     locations: vec![Location::new(4.9041, 52.3676), Location::new(5.1214, 52.0907)],
//!     costing: valhalla_client::Costing::Bicycle,
//!     ..Default::default()
//! };
//!
//! let response = valhalla.route(manifest).unwrap();
//!
//! println!("{:#?}", response);
//!
//! // If the gpx feature is enabled, you can convert the response to a gpx::Gpx object
//! // let gpx = response.trip.into();
//! ```
